		The RAPTR is an automatic mag–fed shotgun born in the Zone and tailored to the specific needs of that dangerous part of the world. The RAPTR is often called "Bloosuckers Killer" by stalkers. Indeed, its high rate of fire, large magazine and unparalled ergonomics makes it the perfect weapon to kill the fast moving and invisible targets that the bloodsuckers are. Considered mainly as a fancy gun–nut weapon in the past few years, the RAPTR popularity among stalkers started to raise during the recent bloodsuckers nests blooming. It is now considered as one of the finest 12x70 gun in the Zone.\n
