 A rare kit that is a real love letter to both old and modern weapons gun nuts. It contains all the necessary parts to convert the famous WW2 Mauser K98 German rifle to a modern bolt action sniper rifle with a light weight polymer stock and receiver. It also comes bundled with a high zoom variable scope. That kit is highly appreciated in the Zone because the K98 is often used by novice stalkers and it makes that sniper rifle much more easy to use, especially with the modern scope it comes with. Even in 2018, the 7.92x57mm caliber packs a lot of punch while harboring proper armor penetration power while it remains cheap, which explains its popularity among stalkers. \n </text>
